This does not work very well at all.
performance is slightly better when using the function name and a very simple description
picking one word from the description seems to work slightly better (as seen in prime).

This could never work that well currently, as the description generation causes lots of problems.

We can see here that the description lookup is functional, but descriptions do not match the functions.

I think that it is being confused by all the boiler plate code required by laminar to generate PEs.
If we restrict what information we pass in by removing the 'bookends' then we should get better results.
